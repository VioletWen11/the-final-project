# the final project : Roller Coasters 

Welcome to our website.

Information Management and Information System.

# Grade

We are in grade two.

# Introduction

When it comes to roller coasters, the first thing comes into your mind must be the excitement they bring. However, while roller coasters bring people joy ï¼Œtheir safety issues have also become the top priority of public attention.
we divide our final project into four parts.

# Part 1 Safet speed

According to the formula for circular motion v = (gr)^0.5, we choose g = 9.8 and r = height/2 to calculate the safe speed of roller coasters.

As a result, the safe speed on the top should be between 0 and 35. In order to build a safe roller coasters, the safe speed should be considered seriously.

# Part 2 Material Type

according to the data, there are about four different types of roller coasters. It can be seen from the data that steel is the most used material for roller coasters , while hybrid is the least. 

Steel roller coasters are made for longer spans, more unique and more stable structures. Wooden roller coaster is the oldest and most classic, it can give people a unique sense of ups and downs, now the market began to use a new type of  mixed roller coaster, integrated the above two advantages.

# Part 3 Regression Analysis

We use Excel to find the correlation of speed and height.

The linear function we find is height = 0.5518 speed - 12.161. Since the P value is small, the model is doable.

And When we select the data of high ranking roller coasters, we find the regression is dramatic.

# Part 4 Popularity

The most popular 5 parks: Cedar Point, Carowinds, Six Flags New England, Six Flags Fiesta Texas and Holiday Park. 

The best 4 suppliers: Intamin, Rocky Mountain, B & M, and RMC

You will see more graphs on our app, and there are three filters(minimal points, parks and three catrgories of points the roller coasters got).

# Conclusion

In our final project, we firstly studied the safety of roller coasters and the relationship between height and speed.

Secondly, we analysed the popularity of different types of roller coasters around the world using three filters, and found out the most popular parks and manufacturers.

Hope these will help you understand better of the dataset of roller coasters.
